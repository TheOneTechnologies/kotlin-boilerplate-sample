# New Features!

  - This project contains the Clean architecture of the Kotlin Programming
  - We have Used the Observer and design patters as per the latest architecture components
  - In this sample demo we have implemented the MVVM coding structure using the View model and Databinding.

Kotlin-boilerplate-sample contains following directory structure. 
*  data  :It contains API classes.  

*  domain :It contains model, interfaces and utility classes.

*  presentation : It contains Activities, Adapters and ViewModels..

### Tech

Kotlin-boilerplate-sample uses the follow techs and specs:

* **Kotlin** - Back end programming use for the mobile apps!
* **XML** - XML is for the UI/UX(Front End) developed into the XML Tags i.e. TextView,EditText...
* **Android Studio** - An Editor tool use for the write kotlin and xml code into it.
* **AVD** - It's Debugger tool use for the developer to debug the application in Android studio editor.

## Languages, libraries and tools used
   *  Android Studio 4.0  
   *  Kotlin (Application development language)
   *  Retrofit (for API calls) 
   *  Coil  (Image loader class)
   *  CircleImageView  (Circle image class)
   *  RxAndroid: Reactive Extensions 
   *  SDP scalable (SDP for the text of the application)
